## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

### 1. **Project Setup**
- Generate project template with `template.py`.
- Manage local packages with `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`.
- Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.

### 2. **Data Management**
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** for secure, scalable cloud data storage.
- Ingest, validate, and transform data using modular pipeline components.
- Push and pull data using custom utility scripts and configuration files.

### 3. **Model Lifecycle**
- Train models locally or via the web interface.
- Store and manage models in AWS S3.
- Evaluate and push new models automatically when performance improves.

### 4. **Web Application**
- FastAPI serves a modern, interactive UI for predictions and retraining.
- Jinja2 templates and static assets for a polished user experience.

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **GitHub Actions** automates build, test, and deployment:
  - Build Docker images and push to AWS ECR.
  - Deploy containers to an EC2 instance via a self-hosted runner.
  - Securely manage secrets and environment variables.
- **Live deployment**: App is always up-to-date with the latest code and model.

### 6. **Cloud Integration**
- **AWS IAM** for secure access management.
- **AWS S3** for model registry.
- **AWS ECR** for container image storage.
- **AWS EC2** for scalable, production-grade hosting.

## 📝 Notebooks & Experimentation

- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and data exploration.
- Demonstrations of data ingestion, validation, and transformation.
- Push datasets directly to MongoDB from notebooks.

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- All secrets managed via GitHub Secrets.
- `.gitignore` includes sensitive directories.
- Logging and exception handling modules for robust monitoring.

---

## 🏁 Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Set up your environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n vehicle python=3.12 -y
   conda activate vehicle
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure MongoDB and AWS**
   - Set `MONGODB_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` as environment variables.
4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```
5. **Access the web UI**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000` (or your EC2 public IP and port).

---

## 🌍 Deployment Workflow

1. **Push code to GitHub → CI/CD pipeline triggers**
2. **Docker image built and pushed to AWS ECR**
3. **EC2 self-hosted runner pulls and runs the latest image**
4. **App live at your EC2 public IP and port**

---

## 📈 Model Training & Retraining

- Trigger model retraining via the `/train` route in the web UI.
- Automatic model evaluation and registry update in AWS S3.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Truly production-ready**: Not just a notebook—this is a full-stack MLOps pipeline.
- **Cloud-first**: Uses industry-standard cloud services for scalability and reliability.
- **Automated everything**: From data to deployment, all steps are automated.
- **Modern stack**: FastAPI, Docker, AWS, MongoDB, and CI/CD.
- **Impressive for recruiters**: Demonstrates real-world, end-to-end ML engineering.
